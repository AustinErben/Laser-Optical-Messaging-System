# LaserOpticalMessagingSystem

This project utilizes 2 Arduino boards, one acts as a transceiver and the other as a receiver. The transceiver uses the Morse library to encrypt a string into morse code and projects the message using a laser diode controlled by the transceiver board. The diode, directed toward the photovoltaic cell which is controlled by the receiver, takes the encrypted data and translates it back to text which is then displayed on the terminal.
