# LaserOpticalMessagingSystem

Materials

-2 Arduino boards
-Laser diode
-Photovoltaic cell

Summary

This project utilizes 2 Arduino boards: a transceiver and a receiver. The transceiver uses the Morse library to encrypt a string into morse code and projects the message using a laser diode controlled by the transceiver board. The diode is directed toward the photovoltaic cell that is controlled by the receiver. The receiver takes the encrypted data and translates it back to text which is then displayed on the terminal of the connected computer.
